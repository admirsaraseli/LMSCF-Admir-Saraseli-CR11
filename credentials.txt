Dear trainers,

I wanted to use the same background-image for login file like in the crud folder but i do not understand why it does not work!!!
One more thing is that when i click to 'deleteUser' button in superadmin page it does not goes to deleteUser.php page but to 
super_admin.php page that I renamed to superadmin.php page!!!

Thank you
Admir
